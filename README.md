## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow For styles

### What I learned

During this project, I enhanced my skills in several key areas:

Semantic HTML5: I used semantic tags to provide clear structure and meaning to
the content, improving accessibility and SEO.

CSS Flexbox: Flexbox was used to create a flexible, responsive layout that
adapts well to different screen sizes.

CSS Custom Properties: I utilized CSS variables to create a consistent color
scheme and make future updates easier.

```html
<h1 class="product-title">Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h1>
```

```css
.product-card {
  width: 95%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background-color: var(--White);
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to:

-Refine my CSS Flexbox skills: Continue exploring more complex layouts and
responsive design techniques with Flexbox. -Improve accessibility: Focus on
making web pages more accessible by using proper semantic elements and ARIA
attributes.

### Useful resource

CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox - This guide was instrumental in
helping me understand Flexbox and how to implement it effectively.
